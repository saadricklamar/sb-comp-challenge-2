This Static Comp had us replicate an in-depth profile page with a sidebar, searchbar, and graphs. Since I did an NBA theme 
for my CARD UI, I decided to stick with that theme by creating an NBA profile page. Users can search for specific teams, 
players, or statistical categories. This site is fairly responsive when it comes to tablets and mobile phones.
